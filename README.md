# Machine Learning model to detect cyberattacks on IoT devices

Machine Learning model for the automatic detection of cyber attacks on IoT devices through the use of their traffic data, developed with the Big Data PySpark framework of Apache Spark.
Oveer 7 million records of data traffic generated between devices, from source to destination. To handle this vast dataset, I employed the Apache Spark framework's PySpark. The process encompassed everything from data processing to model creation. The model's objective is to identify whether a device is infected with one of the categorized nine types of malware or if it's clean.
