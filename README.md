This repository contains a Python code implementation for a machine learning model that focuses on cyber security attack detection. 
The model is trained using PySpark and leverages big data techniques to handle a dataset containing more than 7 million records. 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient solution for identifying and classifying cyber security attacks.

The MAIN folder has the modeling.py file that is the main code to train the Random Forest model

The Other folder contain the code to read and pre process the data.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project comprises a comprehensive collection of cyber security attack instances collected from a S3 Bucket
It includes features related to network traffic, system logs, and various indicators of attacks. 
The dataset has been preprocessed to anonymize sensitive information and ensure its usability for research and analysis.
